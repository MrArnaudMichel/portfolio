At UTBM (Université de Technologie de Belfort‑Montbéliard), I strengthened my engineering fundamentals across low‑level C/C++ programming, networking, databases, and modern web development. Projects included STM32 embedded programming, a JavaFX game based on Turing Machine, and building a learning platform inspired by Moodle — all with a strong focus on teamwork, testing, and documentation.
