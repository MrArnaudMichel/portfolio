Aictron is a lightweight web application that enables users to upload any CSV dataset and receive predictive analytics powered by **machine learning**. :br Its main strength lies in its **simplicity** and **efficiency**, making it accessible for anyone needing quick predictions without heavy infrastructure.

---

## Features

::steps
  :::step
  **CSV Upload** – Import your dataset in `.csv` format directly from the interface.
  :::

  :::step
  **Target Selection** – Choose the column you want to predict.
  :::

  :::step
  **AI Predictions** – Leverages **scikit-learn (SKlearn)** models to generate predictions.
  :::

  :::step
  **User-Friendly** – Clean, simple, and responsive interface built for accessibility.
