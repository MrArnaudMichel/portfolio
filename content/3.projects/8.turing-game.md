**Turing Machine Game** is a digital adaptation of the famous deduction board game *Turing Machine*, paying tribute to **Alan Turing**, the pioneer of computer science and cryptography.  
This version, designed at **UTBM**, reimagines the game in a student context — where players solve algorithmic puzzles to gain access to an exam room.

## 🎯 Project concept

Players receive a **challenge email from a professor** containing a logical **riddle**.  
To enter the exam room, each student must find the correct **password** by proposing combinations that are tested against the rules of the riddle.

Each password:
- Is **unique**, generated based on the student’s **INE** (student ID)
- Must satisfy a set of logical conditions
- Becomes invalid after each use to prevent cheating

Before starting, players choose a **difficulty level**, which affects both the complexity of the riddle and the **score multiplier** (from ×1.0 to ×1.8).

A **multiplayer mode** is also available, where students compete to find the solution first — in this case, no INE is required.

## 🧩 Game features

- **Authentication** using INE
- **Difficulty selection** impacting logic depth and scoring
- **Unique password generation** per player
- **Validation system** for each proposed password
- **Multiplayer mode** with real-time competition

## ⚙️ Core logic

To compute a unique solution, we designed a **recursive functional filtering system** that progressively narrows down possibilities.

Mathematically, the solution space starts with 125 combinations:
\[
\Omega = \{ (x_1, x_2, x_3) \mid x_i \in \{1,2,3,4,5\} \}
\]
Each filtering function \( f_k \) reduces this space until a single valid combination remains:
\[
\Omega_k = f_k(\Omega_{k-1}), \text{ stopping when } |\Omega_k| = 1
\]
If multiple combinations remain after 6 iterations, the system backtracks and retries with a new function sequence.

This approach guarantees both **determinism** and **mathematical rigor** in puzzle generation.

## 👥 Team responsibilities

- **Arnaud Michel** — Application architecture, sequence & class diagrams, report writing
- **Antoine Laurant** — Game logic, round management sequence design, report review
- **Antoine Perrin** — Use case modeling, rule analysis and adaptation, report proofreading

## 💡 Design decisions

### Model–View–Controller (MVC)
We chose the **MVC architecture** to separate data, interface, and control logic — ensuring a clean and modular structure.

### Recursive solution generation
The recursive function-based model ensures a **unique and logically consistent** solution every time a new game is created.

### Modern UI with JavaFX
We opted for **JavaFX** over Swing for its performance, design capabilities, and modern aesthetic aligned with the UTBM’s visual standards.

## 🧮 Example diagrams

Sequence diagrams were created to illustrate key processes such as **game initialization** and **round handling**.  
These UML representations were used to validate system behavior and ensure synchronization between the model and view.
