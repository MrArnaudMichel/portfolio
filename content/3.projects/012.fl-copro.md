## Role & Impact

- Frontend development (Angular) and deployment automation (CI/CD)
- Backend development with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB
- Authentication and role-based permissions
- Product and UX design (input flows, report structure, navigation)
- Reusable design system (UI components)

**Outcome:** less friction during visits, faster data entry, and consistent reports that are easy to review later.
