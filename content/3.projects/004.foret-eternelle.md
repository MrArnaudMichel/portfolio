[**Pokémon Forêt Éternelle**](https://foret-eternelle.fr) is a **fan-made Pokémon game** created with the [**Pokémon SDK**](https://pokemonworkshop.com) and [**LiteRGSS (Ruby)**](https://psdk.pokemonworkshop.com/yard/LiteRGSS.html).  
Started in 2012, it delivers a unique Pokémon experience with a **darker story**, **strategic battles**, and a **Pokédex of over 170 original Fakemon**.

## Synopsis

You play as a young trainer who wins the **Junior Tournament in Pallet Town**.  
But when you return home, your parents have vanished. A letter reveals the truth: they’ve been **kidnapped**.

At nightfall, a **mysterious man in black** confronts you with a terrible condition. To save them, you must commit the unthinkable:  
**steal a Pokémon from Professor Oak’s lab**.

This is the beginning of your forced infiltration into **Team Rocket**, where loyalty and morality blur.  
Across **Kanto**, the **Orange Archipelago**, and beyond, your journey is shaped by choices that will test both your duty and your conscience.

## My Contributions

### Enhancing the Player Experience

I focused on **game systems and user experience**, implementing features that make gameplay smoother, more accessible, and immersive:

- **Menu UX improvements**: streamlined navigation for quicker access to key options.
- **Quick-use item shortcuts**: allowing immediate item usage during exploration and battles.
- **Evolutionary item integration**: ensuring new evolution mechanics were supported and balanced.
- **HUD panels**: providing real-time information such as HP, status effects, or objectives.
- **Discord bot development**: a community tool enabling players to fetch in-game data and information with commands.

Each of these contributions reduces friction and ensures players always feel connected — both in-game and in the wider community.

## Game Features

### Expanding the Universe
The game reimagines classic regions like **Kanto** and the **Orange Archipelago**, adding new areas, ruins, and secrets.  
Exploration is key: players uncover hidden lore, optional quests, and world-building details that enrich the adventure.

### A Darker Storyline
Unlike traditional Pokémon titles, Forêt Éternelle explores themes of **morality, duty, and consequence**.  
The **karma system** ensures that choices — from small interactions to major story beats — shape how the world reacts to you.

### Smarter AI
Battles are more challenging thanks to a **custom AI system**.  
Trainers adapt their strategies depending on their class and team composition, forcing players to think beyond type advantages.

## Community & Future

Pokémon Forêt Éternelle is a **non-commercial fan project**, created *by fans, for fans*.
