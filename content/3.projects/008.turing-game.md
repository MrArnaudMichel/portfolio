**Turing Machine Game** is a digital adaptation of the famous deduction board game *Turing Machine*, paying tribute to **Alan Turing**, the pioneer of computer science and cryptography.  
This version, designed at **UTBM**, reimagines the game in a student context — where players solve algorithmic puzzles to gain access to an exam room.

## Project concept

Players receive a **challenge email from a professor** containing a logical **riddle**.  
To enter the exam room, each student must find the correct **password** by proposing combinations that are tested against the rules of the riddle.

Each password:
- Is **unique**, generated based on the student’s **INE** (student ID)
- Must satisfy a set of logical conditions
- Becomes invalid after each use to prevent cheating

Before starting, players choose a **difficulty level**, which affects both the complexity of the riddle and the **score multiplier** (from ×1.0 to ×1.8).

A **multiplayer mode** is also available, where students compete to find the solution first — in this case, no INE is required.

## Game features

- **Difficulty selection** impacting logic depth and scoring
- **Validation system** for each proposed password
- **Multiplayer mode** with real-time competition

## Core logic

To compute a unique solution, we designed a **recursive functional filtering system** that progressively narrows down possibilities.

Ω = { (x₁, x₂, x₃) | xᵢ ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} for i = 1, 2, 3 }

Each filtering function (noted f₁, f₂, f₃, …) reduces this set step by step:

Ωₖ = fₖ(Ωₖ₋₁)

The process continues until there is only one combination left (|Ωₖ| = 1).
If, after six filtering steps, more than one combination remains, the algorithm **backtracks** and tries a new sequence of filtering functions.

This guarantees that each puzzle produces a **single valid solution**, determined through a logical and **deterministic** process.

## Team responsibilities

- **Arnaud Michel** — Application architecture, Game core logic, report writing
- **Antoine Laurant** — Sequence & class diagrams, round management sequence design, report review
- **Antoine Perrin** — Use case modeling, rule analysis and adaptation, report proofreading

**Turing Machine Game** combines logic, mathematics, and software engineering to deliver a faithful yet original digital experience — both a technical and creative tribute to Alan Turing’s legacy.
