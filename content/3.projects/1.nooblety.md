## 🏰 Game overview

The game is set in the town of Amboise, a bustling medieval city during the Renaissance period. Your character is born as a humble peasant, and you have the freedom to choose how they will grow and evolve. You can focus on maximizing profits by selling crops and livestock, or take on the challenging path of building a network of relationships and a strong reputation among the different social classes. Once your character’s life comes to an end, they will leave behind a son, and you will then take control of the next generation’s fate.

With the resources and reputation accumulated by the previous character, you’ll be able to choose a new occupation for the son. This new character, born with different opportunities, can then undertake various quests to gain the favor of the nobility. The game continues with each successive generation until your lineage either reaches the highly coveted noble status or the predetermined number of generations comes to an end.
