**PlantUML Parser** is a **Java library** designed to automatically generate **UML class diagrams** from Java source packages.  
Built as a **custom Javadoc Doclet**, it integrates seamlessly into Java documentation workflows to extract structure, associations, and dependencies — and outputs them as **PlantUML (`.puml`) files** ready for rendering.

## Project Overview

This project started as an academic challenge to explore **Javadoc’s Doclet API** and automate **reverse-engineering UML diagrams** directly from Java codebases.

The result is a flexible command-line tool and API that can:
- Parse **classes, interfaces, enums, and packages**
- Detect **inheritance**, **implementations**, and **aggregations**
- Recognize **dependencies** and **usages**
- Include **Javadoc comments** and **annotations** in UML output
- Offer **fine-grained customization** via CLI options and config files

The library can be used standalone or integrated into build tools (e.g. Maven, Gradle) to keep UML diagrams synchronized with code.

## Architecture

The library is built around a modular structure:

- **`PumlDoclet`** — Core entry point for Javadoc, handling parsing and configuration.
- **`Java2Puml`** — Command-line utility that runs the Doclet and produces `.puml` output.
- **`PumlWriter`** — Handles UML syntax generation and file writing.
- **`CreateFic`** — Manages output file creation and directory structure.
- **`Package`, `Classe`, `Interface`, `Enum`** — Represent parsed Java elements and their relationships.
- **`Config`** — Central configuration system with command-line and file-based options.

Each module was designed for **reusability** and **extensibility**, making it possible to integrate with other tools or modify the diagram generation logic.

## My Role

As **Lead Developer**, I was responsible for the **entire architecture, implementation, and feature set** of the library.

### Core contributions

- Designed and implemented the **Doclet-based parser**
- Developed the **UML generation engine** (DCA and DCC modes)
- Implemented detection of **classes, interfaces, enums, attributes, and methods**
- Added support for **extends**, **implements**, and **non-primitive type associations**
- Integrated **Javadoc comment parsing** into the UML output
- Created **CLI options**:
  - `--out`, `--d` for output file/directory
  - `--dca` / `--dcc` to switch diagram modes
  - `--use` to include dependency relationships
  - `--str` to treat `String` as a primitive type
  - `--config` to load configuration from a file
- Implemented **configuration and validation system** for flexible diagram generation

## Features

::steps
  **Automatic UML Generation**  
  Extracts complete structure and relationships from Java packages into PlantUML syntax.
  
  **Customizable Output**  
  CLI options and config files let you include/exclude methods, attributes, associations, and more.
  
  **Supports DCA & DCC Diagrams**  
  Generates both **simplified** and **detailed** UML class diagrams.
  
  **Dependency Detection**  
  Detects and visualizes uses, aggregations, and compositions between classes.
  
  **Javadoc Integration**  
  Parses comments and tags like `@pumlNameAssociation`, `@pumlUse`, `@pumlMultiplicity` to enrich diagrams.
  
  **Recursive Package Handling**  
  Automatically processes nested packages to generate global project diagrams.
