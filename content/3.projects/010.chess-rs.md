## Overview

Chess.rs is a chess game application built entirely in Rust using GTK-RS for the graphical user interface. This project demonstrates the power of Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics combined with GTK's mature GUI toolkit to create a fully functional chess game.

The application provides a complete chess experience with a clean, intuitive interface and all standard chess rules implemented, including special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.

## Key Features

### Chess Engine

- **Complete rule implementation**: All standard chess rules including check, checkmate, and stalemate detection
- **Move validation**: Real-time validation of legal moves for each piece
- **Special moves**: Support for castling, en passant, and pawn promotion
- **Game state management**: Tracking of game history, captured pieces, and turn management
- **Checkmate detection**: Automatic detection of checkmate and stalemate conditions

### User Interface

- **GTK-RS based GUI**: Modern, native-looking interface built with GTK4
- **Interactive board**: Click-to-move interface with visual feedback
- **Move highlighting**: Visual indicators for possible moves and selected pieces
- **Status display**: Current player turn, check status, and captured pieces
- **Game history**: Complete move history with navigation

### Game Management

- **New game**: Start a new game at any time
- **Move undo/redo**: Navigate through game history
