**STM32 Analog to Digital Converter, Timers & USART** is an embedded systems project carried out on an **STM32 Nucleo-64 board**, aiming to understand how different peripherals interact in a microcontroller environment.

The goal was to combine **timers**, **analog-to-digital conversion**, and **serial communication** into a single coherent system — a small but complete embedded application built in **C**.

## About the Project

The project explores three key components of the STM32 ecosystem:

- **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** — controlling the brightness of an LED by adjusting the duty cycle of a signal.
- **ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)** — reading analog input from a potentiometer and internal temperature sensor.
- **UART (Serial Communication)** — sending sensor data to a computer every second via the serial port.

Together, these elements form a simple **data acquisition and visualization system**, where sensor readings are measured, processed, and transmitted automatically.

## My Role & Contributions

As the **developer**, I was responsible for the full setup and integration of the STM32 peripherals:

- Configured **timers** to generate periodic interrupts and PWM signals.
- Programmed the **ADC** to capture analog values and convert them to digital readings.
- Implemented **UART communication** to send temperature and voltage data to a serial monitor.
- Used **interrupts** to manage synchronization and improve real-time behavior.

This required a solid understanding of **register-level programming**, **microcontroller architecture**, and **data flow between peripherals**.

## Example of Integration

Every second, the system:
1. Reads the potentiometer and temperature sensor using the ADC.
2. Adjusts the LED brightness proportionally through PWM.
3. Sends both readings to the serial monitor via UART.

This cycle runs autonomously through **timer interrupts**, illustrating how STM32 peripherals cooperate without relying on an operating system.

## Skills Developed

- **Embedded C programming** for hardware-level control.
- **Timer and interrupt management** for periodic task execution.
- **Signal acquisition and processing** using ADC.
- **Serial communication protocols** (UART).
- **Understanding of low-level system design** on ARM Cortex-M architectures.

## Summary

This project offered a practical introduction to **embedded systems engineering**, bridging software logic and hardware control.  
It demonstrated how to design reliable, low-level systems capable of interacting directly with physical components — a crucial foundation for real-time and IoT applications.
