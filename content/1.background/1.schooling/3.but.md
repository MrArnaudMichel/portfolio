## Curriculum

### Year 1 — Foundations

- Programming: C, C#, Java (basics and OOP with Java)
- Applied mathematics:
  - Linear algebra: matrices, vectors, vector spaces
  - Probability: probabilities, expectations, variances
  - Statistics: practical data analysis with R
  - Graph theory: Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim (implemented in C)
