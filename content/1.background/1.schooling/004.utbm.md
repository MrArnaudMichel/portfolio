## About the University

The **Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard (UTBM)** is one of France’s leading **engineering schools**, part of the national network of *Universités de Technologie* alongside UTC (Compiègne) and UTT (Troyes).  
It follows a **project-based learning model**, blending **academic theory**, **practical experience**, and **research-oriented teaching**.

At UTBM, I pursued a **Computer Science Engineering degree**, designed to train versatile engineers with strong foundations in **programming**, **embedded systems**, **networks**, and **software design**.  
The program combines rigorous scientific courses with numerous **hands-on projects**, encouraging teamwork, innovation, and professional development.

## What I Learned

::steps

### Programming & Software Engineering

My time at UTBM strengthened my programming abilities and software design skills across multiple paradigms.  
I developed, tested, and deployed applications using a broad set of languages and tools:

- **C / C++** → low-level programming, performance optimization, and object-oriented design
- **Java / JavaFX** → desktop applications, graphical interfaces, and advanced OOP principles
- **TypeScript & JavaScript** → modern front-end development and reactive web design
- **PHP** → backend logic, MVC architectures, and dynamic web applications
- **Python** → scripting, prototyping, and automation
- **SQL & PLpgSQL** → complex queries, data integrity, and stored procedures

Through these experiences, I learned to write **clean, maintainable, and modular code**, while understanding the importance of architecture, testing, and documentation.

### Embedded Systems & Hardware Interaction

A strong emphasis was placed on **embedded systems**, where I learned to bridge software with hardware.  
Using **STM32 microcontrollers**, I explored:

- **Analog and digital signal processing**
- **Timer configuration** and **interrupt management**
- **UART communication protocols**
- **Peripheral drivers** and **real-time constraints**
- **Debugging and cross-compilation toolchains**

These projects taught me how systems operate close to the hardware layer and how to design software that interacts efficiently with electronic components.

### Networks, Systems & Cybersecurity

I gained a solid understanding of how computers communicate and how to protect data in distributed environments.  
This included:

- **Network configuration** (routing, VLANs, and addressing)
- **System administration** with **Linux** (processes, permissions, automation via Bash)
- **Security fundamentals** — encryption, authentication, and secure communication protocols
- **Applied cryptography** and **blockchain principles**

These experiences helped me understand how **reliable, secure infrastructures** are built and maintained in modern computing environments.

### Databases & Information Systems

I also deepened my knowledge of **data organization and management**, learning how to model, query, and optimize information systems.  
Topics covered included:

- **Entity–Relationship (ER) modeling** and **UML diagramming**
- **Database normalization** and **transactional integrity**
- **Advanced SQL** with triggers, indexes, and views
- **NoSQL databases** (MongoDB) and data aggregation
- **ETL processes** and basic **data warehousing** concepts

This theoretical foundation was applied through the design of real-world web systems combining **frontend interfaces** with **relational backends**.

### Web Development & Full-Stack Applications

My formation also focused heavily on **modern web development**, emphasizing clean design, scalability, and responsive interaction.  
I practiced:

- Structuring front-end applications with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **TypeScript**
- Building **RESTful APIs** and handling **client-server communication**
- Managing **state**, **components**, and **routing** with frameworks such as **Angular**
- Ensuring **responsive design** and **cross-browser compatibility**
- Using **Git**, **CI/CD**, and **Agile workflows** for versioning and collaboration

These skills allowed me to build and maintain complete web platforms — from backend logic to user experience.

### Mathematics, Algorithms & Theoretical Foundations

The engineering curriculum also provided a strong scientific background through mathematics and algorithmic theory.  
Key areas included:

- **Linear algebra** → matrices, transformations, and eigenvalues
- **Probability & statistics** → data modeling, regression, and hypothesis testing
- **Discrete mathematics** → graphs, automata, and formal logic
- **Information theory** → coding, entropy, and compression
- **Analysis & algebra** → continuous functions and numerical methods

This theoretical grounding enhanced my **problem-solving abilities** and helped me understand the mathematical foundations behind algorithms and computer systems.

### Engineering Approach & Team Collaboration

Every semester involved **collaborative projects**, requiring teamwork, planning, and documentation.  
I learned to:
- Apply **Agile principles** and **SCRUM** organization
- Use **Git and GitHub** for collaborative version control
- Present and defend **technical deliverables** orally and in writing
- Balance **technical quality** with **project deadlines** and **client-oriented goals**

This environment helped me develop not only my technical expertise but also **project management**, **communication**, and **team leadership** skills essential to any engineer.
