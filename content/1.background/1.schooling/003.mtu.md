## What I Learned

::steps

### Academic & Technical Skills

During my Erasmus semester at **Munster Technological University (MTU)** in **Cork, Ireland**, I continued my studies in computer science while improving my **English fluency** and discovering new ways of teaching and collaborating in an international environment.

I attended several English-taught courses focusing on both theoretical and practical computing:

- **Open Source Project Development** → collaborative development practices, version control, and project management
- **Mathematics with R** → probability, linear regression, and statistical data analysis
- **Object-Oriented Programming (Java)** → software architecture, inheritance, and design patterns
- **Low-Level Programming (C)** → memory management, pointers, and performance optimization

This semester gave me a broader perspective on **international teamwork** and **software engineering**, as well as the ability to adapt quickly to new educational methods and technologies.

### Communication & Cultural Experience

Beyond academics, this exchange allowed me to strengthen my **interpersonal and communication skills** in a multicultural environment.  
Working daily with international students helped me gain confidence in **professional English** and develop a strong sense of **adaptability**, **collaboration**, and **open-mindedness** — essential qualities for any engineer working in global teams.

## Projects

During the semester, I contributed to an open-source project as part of my coursework, combining **machine learning**, **web technologies**, and **data analytics**.

This Erasmus experience at MTU was an invaluable opportunity to **grow both technically and personally**, applying my knowledge from the BUT in a **new academic and cultural context**, and learning how to collaborate effectively across borders.
