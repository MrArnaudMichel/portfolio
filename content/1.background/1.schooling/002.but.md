## What I Learned

::steps

### Programming & Software Design

I developed strong programming skills across several paradigms and languages:

- **C** → algorithms, memory management, and performance optimization
- **C# / Unity** → object-oriented programming and game development
- **Java / JavaFX** → advanced OOP and GUI applications
- **PHP & Laravel** → web development with MVC architecture
- **Python & Bash** → scripting and data processing

### Mathematics & Logic

Mathematics played a central role in developing analytical thinking:

::
- Linear algebra: matrices, vectors, and vector spaces
- Probability & statistics: distributions, expectations, and variances
- Discrete math: graphs and combinatorics
- Applied cryptography: modular arithmetic, cipher algorithms

### Networks & Systems

Understanding how machines communicate and operate at a low level:


- Fundamentals of **computer architecture** (CPU, memory, disk)
- Hands-on labs with **Linux**, using C and Bash
- Building **network servers** with sockets and multiple protocols
- Mastering **IP addressing**, **VLANs**, and **routing**

### Databases & Data Modeling

- Designing, querying, and optimizing relational systems:
- SQL & PL/SQL (Oracle)
- Entity–Relationship (ER) modeling
- Stored procedures and transactions

## Projects Built During My Degree

During my degree, I worked on several projects covering **game design**, **web development**, and **desktop applications**.  
Here are the main ones I developed and managed:

<ProjectCard

These projects allowed me to explore **different areas of computer science** — from **game and web development** to **systems programming** — while applying teamwork, version control, and agile principles in real academic environments._
