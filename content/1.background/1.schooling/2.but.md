## What I Learned

::steps

### Programming & Software Design

I developed strong programming skills across several paradigms and languages:

::timeline
  - **C** → algorithms, memory management, and performance optimization
  - **C# / Unity** → object-oriented programming and game development
  - **Java / JavaFX** → advanced OOP and GUI applications
  - **PHP & Laravel** → web development with MVC architecture
  - **Python & Bash** → scripting and data processing
::

### Mathematics & Logic

Mathematics played a central role in developing analytical thinking:

::
- Linear algebra: matrices, vectors, and vector spaces
- Probability & statistics: distributions, expectations, and variances
- Discrete math: graphs and combinatorics
- Applied cryptography: modular arithmetic, cipher algorithms


---

### Networks & Systems

Understanding how machines communicate and operate at a low level:


- Fundamentals of **computer architecture** (CPU, memory, disk)
- Hands-on labs with **Linux**, using C and Bash
- Building **network servers** with sockets and multiple protocols
- Mastering **IP addressing**, **VLANs**, and **routing**

---

### Databases & Data Modeling

- Designing, querying, and optimizing relational systems:

::code-group
  ```sql [SQL]
  SELECT name, grade
  FROM students
  WHERE grade > 15;
  plsql
  Copier le code
  CREATE PROCEDURE raise_salary IS
  BEGIN
    UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1;
  END;
  ```
::
- SQL & PL/SQL (Oracle)
- Entity–Relationship (ER) modeling
- Stored procedures and transactions

## Projects Built During My Degree

During my degree, I worked on several projects covering **game design**, **web development**, and **desktop applications**.  
Here are the main ones I developed and managed:
