## Education

My educational journey began in **primary school**, where I built the foundations of learning, particularly in **mathematics** and **science**. Alongside academics, I developed a strong passion for **sports**, especially **fencing**, a discipline that taught me **focus, perseverance, and self-discipline**.

During **middle school**, I continued to explore my interest in science and technology while staying active in sports. **Fencing** remained an important part of my life, helping me develop a sense of **rigor** and **commitment**.  
At the same time, I deepened my understanding of **core academic subjects**, building strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

In **high school**, this growing passion naturally guided me toward a **scientific path**, strengthening both my academic foundations and my desire to pursue **engineering studies** in higher education.
